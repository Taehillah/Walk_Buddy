# Ishmael L. Mafole Running Application
I made the entire application to assist the walking community measure their daily accomplishments post every walk.

The application basically assists by calculating the average time it takes to walk
a distance in kms, later in steps and miles as well.

It has error handling features that limit the user to enter sensible time to get a score and a medal.
The application also has a dark and light mode capability with a fixed portrait mode orientation. 
Have also embodied full screen on the application.

On a later stage, the application must be able to auto calculate steps via the devices step counters.

Feel free to indulge and grow the app.
