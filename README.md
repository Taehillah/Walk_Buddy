# Ishmael L. Mafole Running Application
I made the entire application to assist the running community measure their accomplishments post every run.

The application basically assists by calculating the average time it takes to run
a race of a set track distance in kms and later in miles as well.

It has error handling features that limit the user to enter sensible time to get a score and a medal.
The application also has a dark and light mode capability with a fixed portrait mode orientation. 
Have also embodied full screen on the application.

Feel free to indulge and grow the app.
